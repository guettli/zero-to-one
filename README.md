# Zero to one: A list of projects which made it to the top 

Inspired by the book [Zero to One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One) I created a list of projects which made it to the top. At the end there are some guesses which projects could make it into the list in the future.

About the book:

> Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future is a 2014 book by the American entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel co-written with Blake Masters. 

## Into: Change is the only constant?

"Change is the only constant" is not true any more. There are some things which won't change soon.

## Linux

The one and only operating system for servers.

Solarix, AIX, HP-UX, .... are dead.

## git

In the past there were many different distributed version control system.

## github

The central place to work on source code in teams.

## Paypal

54% market share, next is stripe with 18%. [Source](https://martech.zone/paypal-statistics-online-payments/)

## Google

More than 90% market share.

## Stackoverflow

The most widely used Q+A plattform for tech related questions.

## Chrome

70% market share. Or even moer if you count chromium based browsers, too.

## HTML

Native GUIs (qt, gtk, tkinter, ....) are hardly used these days.

## http/https

Most other protocols are not used any more.

## email

Although there are many competitors, email is still the single common denominator.

## Wordpress

Many competitors, but no one comes close to the market share of the Wordpress.

## JSON

At the moment most APIs use JSON as data interchange format.

Althoug JSON is limited compared to [proto-buf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers)

# Who will make it to the top?

Wild opinionated guesses

## Kubernetes

At the moment it is on the top yet. Many people still use VPS or services like Heroku.

But I guess sooner or later there won't be an alternative to K8s.

## VSCode

I use PyCharm, but the open source IDE vscode develops fast. I think it will win in the long run.
